## Rebase Mechanism

USDTC uses a smart contract–level rebase mechanism where the total supply increases on a daily basis. The rebase is applied proportionally across all holder balances, ensuring that ownership percentage remains unchanged.

The rebase logic is transparent, deterministic, and fully verifiable on-chain via BscScan.
